      <h1>About Web Scraping</h1>
      <p class="w3-large">Initial thoughts on web scraping as a work would be trivial, easy, and unimportant. However, I have realised through the 4 weeks of internship at Multiverse that it is one of the most important steps in the Data science pipeline which most of us turn a blind eye to. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">Structured data is of paramount importance when it comes to data analytics but more than 70% of  data present online is unstructured and hence is of little use. However, Web scraping allows us to “legally” collect information from thousands of websites and structure the data into desirable format which eases further steps of the Data science pipeline.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">The O*NET database contains a rich set of variables that describe work and worker characteristics, including skill requirements. The O*NET-SOC taxonomy defines the occupations, and the Content Model outlines which information is collected.The Data Collection program brings these frameworks to life with results from the working public. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">Initially, analysing the data in the website created a turmoil, later after a great endeavour we were able to connect the threads of the data. Finally, we obtained 45K skills(technical,non-technical) from the website.</p>

    <h1>About AWS Cloud Platform</h1>
    <p class="w3-large">There exists a number of ways to store data in cloud but I have used Amazon S3 to store files because it provides object (file) storage through a web interface. It's built to store, protect and retrieve data from “buckets” at any time from anywhere on any device. A user creates a bucket, and the bucket stores objects in the cloud. </p>
    <p class="w3-large">AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">In Sprint 3, I took a dive into AWS services and explored API Gateway, Lambda, S3. Furthermore, I uploaded the files in S3 bucket, developed a code for creating API calls for both skills and job titles using POST method and provided authorization to internal teams for these API calls for extracting the required data using API Gateway.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Analysed and modified the code as per requirement for all the error codes generated while accessing the API calls through POSTMAN tool.</p>

    <div class="text1">
    <h1>About BERT</h1>
    <p class="w3-large">The reason for choosing BERT algorithm is that it was developed by Google and it is the most lucrative NLP model available for context matching. Applying BERT, Google is able to understand the relationship between words in a query and present the closest matching result to the searcher.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">In the example below, the context of the word “bank” is different in both sentences.Google needs to process the context of the words before the word “bank” in the first query and after the word “bank” in the second query. This is what bidirectional query processing is. Google can process a query both ways depending on the context.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">FuzzyWuzzy algorithm is mainly used for string matching and hence we used it for matching the job titles. FuzzyWuzzy also has more powerful functions to help with matching strings in more complex situations. The partial ratio() function allows us to perform substring matching.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">For Sprint 4, I had researched multiple String matching algorithms and NLP models for matching the Job titles and skills. Later in my analysis, I found BERT and FuzzyWuzzy algorithms as the best fit for my requirement.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">I’ve applied both BERT and FuzzyWuzzy algorithms on a sample data set of around 2000 job titles and skills.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">I compared the results manually and calculated accuracy using a confusion matrix and these results led us to come to a conclusion of cleaning and normalizing the data to improve accuracy of the algorithm as per the requirement .</p>

      <p class="w3-large">For Sprint 5, I had explored and Worked on NESTA data to get some insights and retrieve the job titles to perform analysis. Finally defined an unified schema for NESTA.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">I had worked on improving the accuracy of the algorithm. For this purpose, I’ve applied BERT algorithm on a sample data set of around 1000 Job titles</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Before and after cleaning the data and evaluated the results manually, calculated accuracy, precision,frequency using confusion matrix.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">These results led us to come to a conclusion of change in True positives and False positives data for the manually cleaned and uncleaned data. Cleaning the data manually and finding the pattern to remove frivolous data is a tedious task.</p>

    <h1>Integrated NESTA with Skills Taxonomy</h1>
    <h3>Study of NESTA website</h3>
    <p class="w3-large">Nesta is a data driven Skill Taxonomy whose data is based on real time job postings data. Several existing skill taxonomies (such as O*Net and ESCO) rely, at least in part, on expert consultation which means that updating the taxonomies can be a long and costly process. In contrast, a data-driven taxonomy like Nesta is easier to update.</p>

    <h1>Study of ESCO & NSDC websites</h1>
    <p class="w3-large">NSDC was set up as part of a national skill development mission to fulfil the growing need in India for skilled manpower across sectors and narrow the existing gap between the demand and supply of skills. It aims to promote skill development by catalyzing creation of large, quality, for-profit vocational institutions. It consists of 24 Industry sectors and 36 sector councils.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">ESCO(European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) works as a dictionary, describing, identifying and classifying professional occupations and skills relevant for the EU labour market and education and training. ESCO provides descriptions of 2942 occupations and 13,485 skills linked to these occupations, translated into 27 languages.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">To preprocess the job aggregation titles, we build the different rule- based algorithms for top five fortune companies data.

      <p class="w3-large">We will take some more samples of job titles from other companies to test the accuracy. We will also clean the data, so that we can have a better version of the taxonomy. For cleaning the data we will need subject matter expertise for the whole taxonomy.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">We have taken Job titles from 58 Job aggregators and normalized them. After normalizing, we tried to find similarities between these titles and EMSI titles using the BERT algorithm. Finally, we analyzed the results with the previous sprint results and found an improvement of 16% in accuracy.</p>
